Picking Numbers

Given an array of integers, find the longest subarray where the absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal to .

n = int(input())
l = list(map(int,input().split()))
m = 0
for i in l:
    c = l.count(i)
    d = l.count(i-1) 
    c = c + d
    if(c>m):
        m = c
print(m)
