Utopian Tree

The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

A Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter is planted at the onset of spring. How tall will the tree be after  growth cycles?

For example, if the number of growth cycles is , the calculations are as follows:

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ht = 1
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if(i%2!=0):
            ht = ht*2
        else:
            ht = ht + 1
    print(ht)
